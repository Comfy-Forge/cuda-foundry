"""Scan a pixi.lock (or conda-lock/explicit) file for known-defective builds.

Published artifacts in this channel are immutable, and metadata patches in
patches/ only protect FUTURE solves — a lockfile that already pins a bad
build keeps installing it silently. This is the self-serve check: run it
against your own lockfile, re-lock anything it flags.

Usage: check_lock.py [pixi.lock ...]        (default: ./pixi.lock)
Exit status: 0 clean, 1 defective build(s) found, 2 usage error.

Matches on the exact .conda filename anywhere in the file, so it works on
pixi.lock, conda-lock.yml, and @EXPLICIT env files alike, with no parser
to keep in sync with lockfile format versions.
